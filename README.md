I this repository you will find a python program that computes the o-vector of a given the chirotope of a uniform oriented matroid.

OM85_nondeg.txt: A data base of chirotopes of uniform oriented matroids.

Ovector.py: Program that computes the o-vector of  a uniform oriented matroid.

korthogonal.py: Module with some functions that help to compute the o-vector.
